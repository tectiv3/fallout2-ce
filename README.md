# Fallout 2 Community Engine

Fallout 2 Community Engine is a fully working re-implementation of the Fallout 2 engine, optimized for a hassle-free experience on multiple platforms.  It provides high resolution support, quality-of-life improvements, and dozens of bug fixes.

This is a fork of the original Fallout2: CE project, which is no longer getting regular updates.

Popular Fallout 2 total conversion mods are partially supported. Original versions of Nevada and Sonora (that do not rely on extended features provided by Sfall) work. [Fallout 2 Restoration Project](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/Fallout2_Restoration_Project) is supported (in Beta). [Fallout Et Tu](https://github.com/rotators/Fo1in2) and [Olympus 2207](https://olympus2207.com) are not yet supported. Other mods (particularly Resurrection and Yesterday) are not tested.

Fallout2: CE has broad (though not total) compatibility with [Sfall](https://github.com/sfall-team/sfall) scripting extensions.  Many traditional Fallout mods work out of the box.

There is also [Fallout 1 Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce) (not affiliated with this fork).

## Installation

You *must* own the game to play. Purchase your copy on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/fallout_2), [Epic Games](https://store.epicgames.com/p/fallout-2) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38410). Download latest [release](https://github.com/fallout2-ce/fallout2-ce/releases) or build from source.

### Windows

[Download](https://github.com/fallout2-ce/fallout2-ce/releases) and unzip into your `Fallout2` folder. Launch the game using `fallout2-ce.exe`.

### Linux

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder somewhere, for example `/home/john/Desktop/Fallout2`.

- Alternatively you can extract the needed files from the GoG installer:

```console
$ sudo apt install innoextract
$ innoextract ~/Downloads/setup_fallout_2_1.02_gog_v1_\(77792\).exe -d Fallout2
```

- Download the Linux release archive, extract `fallout2-ce` and `ce.dat`, and copy them into this folder.

- Run `./fallout2-ce`.

### macOS

> **NOTE**: macOS 10.11 (El Capitan) or higher is required. Runs natively on Intel-based Macs and Apple Silicon.

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout2`.

- Alternatively you can use Fallout 2 from Macplay/The Omni Group as a base - you need to extract game assets from the original bundle. Mount CD/DMG, right click `Fallout 2` -> `Show Package Contents`, navigate to `Contents/Resources`. Copy `GameData` folder somewhere, for example `/Applications/Fallout2`.

- Or if you're a Terminal user and have Homebrew installed you can extract the needed files from the GoG installer.  **Note**: You must use "Offline backup game installer", not the main game installer.

```console
$ brew install innoextract
$ innoextract ~/Downloads/setup_fallout_2_1.02_gog_v1_\(77792\).exe -d fallout2
$ mv fallout2 /Applications/Fallout2
```

- [Download](https://github.com/fallout2-ce/fallout2-ce/releases) and copy `Fallout II Community Edition.app` to this folder.

- Run `Fallout II Community Edition.app`.

### Android

> **NOTE**: Fallout 2 was designed with mouse in mind. There are many controls that require precise cursor positioning, which is not possible with fingers. Current control scheme resembles trackpad usage:
- One finger moves mouse cursor around.
- Tap one finger for left mouse click.
- Tap two fingers for right mouse click (switches mouse cursor mode).
- Move two fingers to scroll current view (map view, worldmap view, inventory scrollers).

> **NOTE**: From Android standpoint release and debug builds are different apps. Both apps require their own copy of game assets and have their own savegames. This is intentional. As a gamer just stick with release version and check for updates.

- Download the Android [release](https://github.com/fallout2-ce/fallout2-ce/releases), which contains an .apk file and `ce.dat`.

- Use Windows installation as a base - it contains data assets needed to play. Copy `Fallout2` folder to your device, for example to `Downloads`. You need `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, `patch000.dat`, and `data` folder. Watch for file names - keep (or make) them lowercased (see [Configuration](#configuration)).  Copy `ce.dat` into this folder.

- Copy `fallout2-ce.apk` from the release to your device. Open it with file explorer, follow instructions (install from unknown source).

- When you run the game for the first time it will immediately present file picker. Select the folder from the first step. Wait until this data is copied. A loading dialog will appear, just wait for about 30 seconds. If you're installing total conversion mod or localized version with a large number of unpacked resources in `data` folder it can take up to 20 minutes. Once copied, the game will start automatically.

### iOS

Building is done from source with your own signing certificate. Two IPA build modes:

- **Slim** (`make ipa`) — bundles only mods and default configs (~5MB game data). User drops `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data/` into the iPad's Documents via Finder/Files after install. Good for personal use if you already manage your game files.
- **All-inclusive** (`make ipa-full`) — also bundles `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data/sound/` from the repo root (~500MB). Ready to install and play. Use this when sharing a build with a friend who doesn't want to manage files manually.

**Always bundled:**

- Mods from `files/mods/` — both `.dat` archives and their `.ini` configs
- Default configs from `files/`: `fallout2.cfg`, `ddraw.ini`, `f2_res.ini`
- `ce.dat`

**Bundled with `ipa-full` only (must be present in repo root before building):**

- `master.dat`, `critter.dat` at the repo root
- `data/sound/` with music ACMs (and any sfx you have extracted)

On first launch the app seeds its Documents folder from the bundle: read-only data (`.dat` files, `data/sound/`, `mods/*.dat`) is symlinked (zero duplication). Writable configs (`.ini`, `fallout2.cfg`, `mods_order.txt`) are copy-once so user edits persist across app updates. The seeder silently skips any bundle item that wasn't included, so the same binary works in both modes. Savegames live in `Documents/data/SAVEGAME/`.

**Build & run:**

```console
$ cmake --preset ios
$ open out/build/ios/fallout2-ce.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode: set your Team (free Apple ID works for personal-device deploys) and pick a unique Bundle Identifier. Pick your iPad as the destination and Cmd+R. For a packaged unsigned IPA you can re-sign with AltStore/Sideloadly:

```console
$ cmake --build --preset ios-release
$ cd out/build/ios && cpack -C RelWithDebInfo
```

**Settings (iOS Settings app → Fallout II):**

- **Resolution** — pick a preset or `Native` (auto-detect from device screen). Overrides `resolution_x`/`resolution_y` in `fallout2.cfg` at launch.
- **Scale** — integer 1..4. Overrides `scale` in `fallout2.cfg`.

**Controls on iPad:**

- One-finger tap → left click; hold → left button held.
- Two-finger tap → right click (cycles cursor mode between walk and attack).
- One-finger drag → scroll map / windows.
- Two-finger drag → mouse wheel.
- **Three-finger swipe down → ESC** (opens options / main menu).
- **Four-finger long press → F6** (quicksave). Hold four fingers on the screen for about half a second.
- **Three-finger long press → hold Shift** (highlights interactable objects — containers, doors, items — while held).
- Taps on the HUD (interface bar / end-turn / end-combat buttons) act as direct touches so small buttons are easy to hit without aiming.
- A Bluetooth keyboard works for everything else (numbered dialog choices, load game, etc.).

Saves live in the app's Documents folder and persist across reinstalls on the same Bundle ID. To override any config manually, use Finder → your iPad → Files → Fallout 2, or the Files app on the iPad itself.

### Browser

> **NOTE**: WebAssembly build with emscripten
```
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/src emscripten/emsdk:3.1.74 sh -c 'git config --global --add safe.directory "*" && mkdir -p build && cd build && emcmake cmake ../ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain/Emscripten.cmake && emmake make'
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `fallout2.cfg`. There are several important settings you might need to adjust for your installation. Depending on your Fallout distribution main game assets `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, `patch000.dat`, and `data` folder might be either all lowercased, or all uppercased. You can either update `master_dat`, `critter_dat`, `master_patches` and `critter_patches` settings to match your file names, or rename files to match entries in your `fallout2.cfg`.

The `sound` folder (with `music` folder inside) might be located either in `data` folder, or be in the Fallout folder. Update `music_path1` setting to match your hierarchy, usually it's `data/sound/music/` or `sound/music/`. Make sure it matches your path exactly (so it might be `SOUND/MUSIC/` if you've installed Fallout from CD). Music files themselves (with `ACM` extension) should be all uppercased, regardless of `sound` and `music` folders.

Additional settings for screen resolution, UI customization, and map options are now integrated into the main `fallout2.cfg` file (previously part of `f2_res.ini` from Mash's HRP). When Fallout 2 CE starts, if it detects an existing `f2_res.ini` file, it automatically migrates these settings into `fallout2.cfg`. After migration, `fallout2.cfg` becomes the single source of truth for this configuration.

Here are some important settings in `fallout2.cfg` under the `[screen]` and `[ui]` sections.  See [the example config](https://github.com/fallout2-ce/fallout2-ce/tree/refs/heads/main/files/fallout2.cfg) for a full list of settings.

```ini
[screen]
resolution_x=1600 ; actual game window size (screen resolution), in pixels
resolution_y=1080
windowed=1 ; 0 = fullscreen
scale=2 ; 1 = original scale, 2 = 2x scale, etc. (e.g. at scale 2 and screen resolution 1920x1080, in-game resolution will be 960x540, thus every pixel is twice as wide and tall)

[ui]
;Set to 1 to expand the barter/trade window vertically, adding a 4th item slot per side (requires ce.dat)
expand_barter_window=1
;Maximum number of columns shown in the main inventory and loot/steal windows (valid range: 1..2)
inventory_columns=2
splash_screen_size=1 ; Splash screen scaling (0=original size, 1=fit preserving aspect, 2=stretch to fill)
quick_toolbar_visible=0 ; Skills quick access toolbar visibility (iOS only) (0=hidden, 1=visible)
```

**Recommendations:**
- **Desktops**: Use any size you see fit.
- **Tablets**: Set these values to logical resolution of your device, for example iPad Pro 11 is 1668x2388 (pixels), but it's logical resolution is 834x1194 (points).
- **Mobile phones**: Set height to 480, calculate width according to your device screen (aspect) ratio, for example Samsung S21 is 20:9 device, so the width should be 480 * 20 / 9 = 1067.

In time this stuff will receive in-game interface, right now you have to do it manually. To see all currently working fallout2.cfg settings, just run the game once and quit. It will be automatically updated with defaults for every supported setting.
*Note*: Use of the IFACE_BAR settings requires the `f2_res.dat` file, which contains graphical assets. Various versions are available, but one compatible with the above settings can be found here: [f2_res.dat](https://github.com/fallout2-ce/fallout2-ce/raw/refs/heads/main/files/f2_res.dat)

## Quality of life benefits over vanilla Fallout
